Store anything in registry for global-scope such as variable/values, objects, array etc to access from plugins and theme. Get/check values of $_GET and $_POST variables.

== Description ==

The main reason for building this plugin was because wordpress doesn't readily have a central registry system where things can be stored such as variable values, objects, arrays. Which can be retrieved from a global space. This plugin basically tries to  lessen the repeating declarations of variables and etc. It is something quite similar to Magento registry "Mage_Registry", but very light version.

This plugin can also be used as GET and POST request parameters handler. The benefit is, you don't have to check isset($_GET['myparam']) or isset($_POST['myparam']). If the param is not set, it will return a default value you supplied in second param. By default, the default value is false.

Hope this could be of some use.

Usage is very easy, neat and straight forward:

Register a variable method:
	registry()->setVariableName('this is my variable');
	registry()->setMyName('My Name is Rubin Shrestha');

Validate existance of your method and echo:
	if( registry()->hasVaribleName() ) echo 'Has ' . registry()->getVaribleName();

You can still use registry()->myvariableName = 'Some value for this variable';

For GET and POST request handler use it like this:

* For $_GET, you can simply call registry()->request()->getParam('param_key', [default value if any, else blank, will return false]);
* For $_POST, you can simply call registry()->request()->getPost('param_key', [default value if any, else blank; will return false]);
* You can also do registry()->request()->getParams() and registry()->request()->getPosts();
* To check if the page type is $_POST use if( registry()->request()->isPost() ) { //do your stuffs here }
	
== Installation ==

1. Upload Wordpress Registry to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
